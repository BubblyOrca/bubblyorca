:wave: Hey there, I'm Bubbly Orca
I'm a shadowy super-coding data scientist, DJ, and crypto connoisseur. In 2021, I was labeled a criminal (hacker) by NYC officials, now I'm building software to mitigate risk and hacks in Web3. I enjoy listening to Solange while I code. The best way to reach me is through LinkedIn but check out some of my NFTs while you're here: [bubbly orca zone](https://linktr.ee/bubblyorca)
